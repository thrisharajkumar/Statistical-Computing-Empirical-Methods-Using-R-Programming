## ðŸ’¡ Project Highlights

### 1. Supervised Learning & Predictive Modelling
- Developed **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** classifiers for predicting loan approvals
- Addressed missing data, encoded categorical variables, and engineered features
- Tuned models via **grid search** with 10-fold **cross-validation**
- Achieved model performance:  
  - **AUC = 0.7949**  
  - **F1 Score = 0.70**

### 2. Data Wrangling & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Cleaned multi-source financial data (13,824 rows, 63 indicators)
- Applied joins, renaming, and statistical grouping by income & region
- Created violin plots, histograms, bar plots, and time series to reveal trends

### 3. Statistical Simulation & Computing
- Estimated Î» for exponential distribution using **MLE**
- Bootstrapped 1000 samples to build **confidence intervals**: CI = [0.0191, 0.0207]
- Simulated 100,000 trials of discrete distributions
- Demonstrated **Central Limit Theorem** using 50,000 sample means

## ðŸ›  How to Run

### Install R packages:

```r
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "rpart", "randomForest", "caret", "boot",
                   "ggplot2", "e1071", "reshape2", "knitr"))
```

### Run models:

```r
# Load loan dataset
train <- read.csv("data/train.csv")

# Decision Tree
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(Loan_Status ~ ., data = train, method = "class")

# Random Forest
library(randomForest)
rf_model <- randomForest(Loan_Status ~ ., data = train, ntree = 100)
```

### Run bootstrapping:

```r
library(boot)
lambda_hat <- function(x, i) 1 / mean(x[i])
boot_data <- rexp(1000, rate = 0.02)
boot_lambda <- boot(data = boot_data, statistic = lambda_hat, R = 1000)
boot.ci(boot_lambda, type = "perc")
```
